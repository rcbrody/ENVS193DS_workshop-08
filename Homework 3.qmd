## Problems

### Problem 1. Multiple linear regression: model selection and construction (52 points)

Use the information from the `homework-starter-doc.qmd` to do this problem.

#### a. Make a table _or_ list of all the models from class and the last one you constructed on your own. Write a caption for your table. (8 points)  

**Caption:** table captions typically go above the table. Number the table and provide a title. Describe what is in the table (columns and rows).  

**Table:** In your table, each row should be a model with the model number (1, 2, 3, etc.) and the predictors for each model.  

:::{.callout-note}
#### Double check your work!
There should be 5 models total (null model + 4 models with predictors).
:::

#### b. Write a 5-6 sentence "statistical methods" section. (8 points)

Your answer should be in paragraph form and include:  

- how you addressed the central question(s) (i.e. to examine the influence of ____, ____, and ____ on _____, I...)  
- how you chose the final model (i.e. to determine the model that best described ____, I...)  
- how you visually determined that your final model conformed to the assumptions of a linear model (i.e. to evaluate linear model assumptions, I...)  

**To examine the influence of specific leaf area, species, and water treatment on the total biomass of plants, I constructed five different liner models to predict total biomass based on a different combination of the three factors, specific leaf area, species, and water treatment, the structure of each model is shown in Table 1. Then, several diagnostic plots, including a residuals v. fitted plot, a scale-location plot, a QQplot of the residuals, and a constant leverage plot were generated for each plot to check that the models fit the normality and variance assumptions of linear models. Once that was confirmed, I compared the AIC's and of all the models and selected the model that had the lowest AIC, while also making logical sense within the biology of the system and conforming to the assumptions of a linear model.**


#### c. Make a visualization of the model predictions with underlying data for your "best" model. (20 points)  

Show and annotate all your code. For full credit:  

- make the underlying data more transparent than the model predictions  
- display species names in full (not as species codes like ENCCAL or ESCCAL)  
- display water treatment types in full (not as WW or DS)  
- represent well-watered and drought stressed treatments with different colors  
- use colors that are _not_ the default `ggplot()` colors  
- facet your plot by species  
- remove the legend  
- finalize the plot  

:::{.callout-note}
Make sure that the only output is the visualization!
:::

```{r}
model_preds <- ggpredict(model4, 
                         terms = c("water_treatment", 
                                   "species_name"))

model_preds_for_plotting <- as.data.frame(model_preds) %>% 
  rename(water_treatment = x,
         species_name = group,
         total_g = predicted)

```



```{r}
#plot observed data
ggplot(drought_exp_clean, aes(x = water_treatment, y = total_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = water_treatment), alpha = 0.3, size = 1) +  #make each water treatment a different color #set low alpha for high transparency #set size of points to 1
  labs(x = "Water Treatment", y = "Total Plant Mass (g)") + #change axis titles
  facet_wrap(~species_name) + #facet by species_name
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Well watered" = "navyblue", "Drought stressed" = "maroon")) + # set color for each water treatment
  theme_classic()+ #set theme to remove gridlines and look more professional
  theme(legend.position = "none")+ #remove legend

#add predicted data
geom_point(data = model_preds_for_plotting, aes(x = water_treatment, y = total_g, color = water_treatment), alpha = 1, size = 1)+#plot the predicted data from model_preds_for_plotting data frame #set same aesthetics as observed data #set alpha as 1 to make opaque and set size to 1
  geom_errorbar(data = model_preds_for_plotting, aes(x = water_treatment, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high, color = water_treatment), width = 0, size = 0.5)
```

#### d. Write a caption for your visualization. (6 points)  
**Figure 1. This figure displays the total plant mass in grams predicted by Model 4 based on water treatment and species underlaid with the actual observed data. Predicted values are represented by opaque points, while the transparent points represent the observed data. The predicted and observed data is separated into species, each with their own graph, and all points representing well watered plants are navy blue, while drought stressed data is maroon. The bars are showing the 95% confidence interval for the predictions.**

**data from:**
**Valliere, Justin; Zhang, Jacqueline; Sharifi, M.; Rundel, Philip (2019). Data from: Can we condition native plants to increase drought tolerance and improve restoration success? [Dataset]. Dryad. https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v0861f7**

#### e. Write a 3-4 sentence results section. (10 points)

Your answer should be in paragraph form and address the following points:  

- what predictors "best" described total mass (include model statistics here)?  
- on average, what differences did you find between water treatments?  
- on average, what differences did you find between species?  

**Out of the five models tried, Model 4 best predicted the total plant mass. (Multiple Linear Regression, Multiple R-squared = 0.75,	Adjusted R-squared = 0.73, F(7,26) = 27.08, alpha = 0.05,  p-value< 2.2e-16) This suggests that species and water treatment together are significant predictors of total plant mass. On average, plants that were well watered had a higher total mass. Additionally, plants of the species Grindelia camporum and Eschscholzia californica averaged the highest total mass and plants of the species Penstemon centranthifolius tended to have the lowest total mass. **

### Problem 2. Affective visualization (24 points)

In this problem, you will create an **affective visualization** using your personal data in preparation for workshop during week 10.  

In lecture, we talked about the three vertices of data visualization: 1) exploratory, 2) affective, and 3) communicative. We've done a lot of exploratory and communicative visualization, but have yet to think about affective visualization.  

When thinking of affective visualization, you can expand your ideas of what data visualization _could_ be. Some examples of affective visualizations include:  

- [Jill Pelto's paintings](https://www.jillpelto.com/gallery-1)  
- [Lorraine Woodruff-Long's warming strips quilt ](https://www.instagram.com/p/C689Kybxget/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)  
- [Stefanie Posavec and Giorgia Lupi's Dear Data project](https://www.dear-data.com/all)  

**Before starting, update your spreadsheet of observations.**  

#### a. Describe in words what an affective visualization could look like for your personal data (3-5 sentences). (2 points)

**For my personal data collected about my cat's scratching behavior, I could create a pie chart with the proportions of total scratches that occurred during each activity, playing, petting, picking up, and unprovoked. I could further divide each portion of the chart by subcategories. So, the playing section is divided into slices depending on what toy was being played with, the petting section divided into slices depending on what part fo his body I was petting and picking up and unprovoked dont have subcategories. I would make the visualization more affective by illustrating each portion of the pie with visuals that represent that activity (I would draw the different toys for each toy section, draw me picking im up for the picking up portionetc.) Furthermore, I am considering having the pieces of the pie floating around within a larger picture that depicts lucas doing those activities.**


#### b. Create a sketch (on paper) of your idea. (2 points)  

Include a photo of this sketch in your submission.  

#### c. Make a draft of your visualization. (12 points)  

Feel free to be creative with this! _You do not have to do this in R._ You could create a sculpture, painting, textile object, etc.  

If you are making your visualization in R, show the annotated code and the output.  

If you are making your visualization outside of R, include a photo of your visualization in your submission.  

#### d. Write an artist statement. (8 points)

An artist statement gives the audience context to understand your work. Write 4-5 sentences to address:  

- the content of your piece (what are you showing?)  
- the influences (what did techniques/artists/etc. did you find influential in creating your work?)  
- the form of your work (written code, watercolor, oil painting, etc.)  
- your process (how did you create your work?)  

### Problem 3. Statistical critique (36 points)

At this point, you have seen and created a lot of figures for this class. Revisit the paper you chose for your critique and your homework 2, where you described figures or tables in the text. Address the following in full sentences (3-4 sentences each).  

**For this section of your homework, you will be evaluated on the logic, conciseness, and nuance of your critique.**  

#### a. Revisit and summarize (6 points)

What are the statistical tests the authors are using to address their main research question?  

Insert the figure or table you described in Homework 2 here.

**The authors are using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with a log-normal distribution to address their main research question which is to evaluate the effect of habitat restoration treatments on the travel speed of four predator and prey species, moose, bear, caribou, and wolf. They included treatment, microtopography, and land cover as predictors and several other factors as random intercepts. They constructed a model for each species for a total of 4.**

#### b. Visual clarity (10 points)

How clearly did the authors _visually_ represent their statistics in figures? For example, are the x- and y-axes in a logical position? Do they show summary statistics (means and SE, for example) and/or model predictions, and if so, do they show the underlying data?  

**The authors represented their statistics fairly well. The x and y axis are logical, since the researchers want to test the effect of habitat restoration (treatment), on the movement speed of animals, making treatment the explanatory variable and movement speed the response variable. The axisis are labeled informatively with units when appropriate. The box and whisker plots show the median and the spread of the data. The underlying data is included. Each species is represented by its own separate graph. The results are clear and understandable. It is easy to see the difference between treated and untreated and between species.**



#### c. Aesthetic clarity (10 points)

How well did the authors handle "visual clutter"? How would you describe the the data:ink ratio?  

**My main critique is of the color choice. It's uninteresting and there isn't much contrast between the dark grey used for the treated points and the lighter grey used for the untreated points. Replacing the greys with two distinct colors would make the figure more aesthetic and emphasize the two groups more, making not only clearer to understand, but more engaging and likely to be retained by the audience. Also, removing the gridlines would contribute to the overall more polished look, reducing the amount of clutter or unnecessary ink.**

#### d. Recommendations (can be longer than 4 sentences, 10 points)

What recommendations would you make to make the figure better? What would you take out, add, or change? Provide explanations/justifications for each of your recommendations.  

**I would definitely change the greys to colors that are more contrasting and eye catching. The two shades of grey can be difficult to distinguish from one another, more contrasting colors would make differences between the treated and untreated data more visible. Reinforcing these differences is one of the main points of the figure. Removing the grid lines would also be helpful because it reduces visual clutter, making the data easier to focus on, and it makes the figure look more polished and finished so audiences will pay attention more.**
**Since land cover was found to be a significant covariate, I would consider representing the effect of that variable as well. There would still be four plots separated by species, but instead of jitter plots, they would be scatterplots land cover on the x axis and travel speed on the y. The treated and untreated points would be different colors and a line with a confidence interval would be displayed for each set of data (treated and untreated). Since land cover is not the main interest of the researchers, I understand why they didn't include it in the figure, but it would help more fully explain the model they produced. (They made a table for all the linear regression stats, which I think is enough, but just a suggestion). **


**Alternatively**, if they did not represent their statistics in a figure, what kind of figure would you recommend to them? Describe the x- and y-axes, with any geometries and aesthetics (colors, etc.). Provide enough explanation such that someone would be able to create the figure you describe in code. Provide explanations/justifications for the figure you would recommend.
